= BackgrounDRb

BackgrounDRb is a Ruby job server and scheduler. Its main intent is to be
used with Ruby on Rails applications for offloading long-running tasks.
Since a Rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced
from http request/response cycle.

This new release of BackgrounDRb is also modular and can be used without Rails so that any Ruby program or framework can use it.

== Notes

   If you are using UNIX styled scheduler and using activesupport helpers in yaml file, please note that,
   that will not work currently, because activesupport gem is not loaded before reading yaml file.

== Usage
